# Adjacency-List-Graph
Different implementations for an Adjacency List Graph

In this method, I am creating two link lists for the graph.  A common method is to create a dynamic array that holds a link
list for each element. Another common method is to use the STL list and the STL pair. I will create that method later.

If this is your first time looking at graphs using an adjacency list, I highly recommend not to look at my version.  This can
 be a little confusing because there are easier ways to do this.  Come back later when I have finished the other versions.

If you are trying to learn graphs, here is a helpful video that will help explain both versions of creating a graph:

To run this in your terminal:
  g++ main.cpp AdjacencyListGraph.cpp -o a.out
  ./a.out
